I am broadly interested in the development and evolution of cognition. My graduate work has focused on studying cognitive plasticity in *Polistes fuscatus* paper wasps. In addition to manipulating their development, I also test the wasps on a variety of cognitive domains to assess cognitive structure. If you'd like a copy of any of my published papers, please reach out to me at jpardos@umich.edu.

# Hola! I'm Juanita Pardo Sanchez
I am a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. I was born in Colombia and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I attended Georgia Tech for my undergraduate degree where I ran D1 cross country and track. I am now a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan. When I'm not doing science, I'm likely on a run.
